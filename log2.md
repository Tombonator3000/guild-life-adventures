## 2026-02-14 - Project Documentation Overhaul

### Overview

Created `log2.md` and `MEMORY.md` to improve project maintainability and AI context continuity.

**Reason**: `log.md` grew to 14,278 lines (732KB) — too large to read in a single pass. New development entries go here in `log2.md`. The original `log.md` is preserved as-is for historical reference.

**MEMORY.md** created as a master project reference — a single document that contains everything an AI assistant (or new developer) needs to understand the full project: architecture, file map, game mechanics, documentation index, development conventions, and current status. It cross-references all other .md files.

### Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `log2.md` | New development log (this file), continuation of log.md |
| `MEMORY.md` | Master project reference — architecture, status, conventions, cross-references |
