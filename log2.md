## 2026-02-14 - PWA Infinite Loading Fix (Round 2)

### Overview (08:30 UTC)

**Recurring critical bug**: Every time GitHub Pages deploys a new version and the user clicks "Update Now", the game hangs on the loading screen forever and never starts. This was supposedly fixed earlier on 2026-02-14, but the fix was insufficient — the bug kept recurring.

### Root Cause Analysis

The PWA update system had **two paths** when the user clicked "Update Now":
- **Path A (version mismatch)**: `hardRefresh()` → unregister SWs, clear caches, reload. **This worked.**
- **Path B (SW update only)**: `updateServiceWorker(true)` → sends skip-waiting message to new SW. **This was broken.**

**Why Path B caused infinite loading:**

1. `updateServiceWorker(true)` from vite-pwa sends a `postMessage({ type: 'SKIP_WAITING' })` to the waiting service worker
2. The new SW activates immediately (`skipWaiting: true` + `clientsClaim: true` in vite.config.ts)
3. The new SW takes control and starts serving **new** assets (JS bundles with new hashes)
4. But **no page reload ever happens** — the old JavaScript keeps running in memory
5. Old JS tries to import modules or fetch assets that no longer exist (hash mismatch)
6. React fails to mount or crashes silently → loading screen stays forever

The comment at line 63 of `useAppUpdate.ts` claimed: *"The page reloads when the new SW takes control via the controllerchange event"* — but **no controllerchange event listener was ever registered**. This was a documentation lie.

### Fixes Applied

**1. Always use `hardRefresh()` for user-triggered updates** (`useAppUpdate.ts`)
- Removed the `updateServiceWorker(true)` code path entirely
- Both version mismatch AND SW update now go through the same reliable `hardRefresh()` path
- `hardRefresh()` = unregister all SWs + clear all caches + `window.location.reload()`
- No more race condition between old JS and new SW

**2. Added `controllerchange` event listener** (`useAppUpdate.ts`)
- Safety net for automatic SW activations (not user-triggered)
- If a new SW takes control via auto-update, the page now reloads automatically
- Respects the 30-second throttle to prevent reload loops
- Properly cleaned up on unmount

**3. Improved index.html fallback timer** (`index.html`)
- Previous: single 8s timeout, one-shot check
- Now: checks at both 8s and 15s (second chance for slow connections)
- Extracted to named function `guildFallbackCheck()` for reuse
- Guards against adding duplicate buttons (checks `.fallback-btn` class)

### Files Changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/hooks/useAppUpdate.ts` | Removed `updateServiceWorker` path; `updateApp` always calls `hardRefresh()`; added `controllerchange` listener |
| `index.html` | Dual fallback timer (8s + 15s); extracted to named function; duplicate guard |

### Technical Details

**Before (broken):**
```typescript
const updateApp = useCallback(async () => {
  if (versionMismatch) {
    await hardRefresh();           // ← This worked
  } else {
    await updateServiceWorker(true); // ← This caused infinite loading
  }
}, [versionMismatch, updateServiceWorker]);
```

**After (fixed):**
```typescript
const updateApp = useCallback(async () => {
  await hardRefresh(); // Always reliable: unregister SW + clear caches + reload
}, []);
```

**New safety net:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const onControllerChange = () => {
    if (canAutoReload()) {
      markAutoReload();
      window.location.reload();
    }
  };
  navigator.serviceWorker?.addEventListener('controllerchange', onControllerChange);
  return () => {
    navigator.serviceWorker?.removeEventListener('controllerchange', onControllerChange);
  };
}, []);
```

### Test Results
- 185 tests passing (9 files, 0 failures)
- Build succeeds cleanly

## 2026-02-14 - Home Action Cleanup, Newspaper Restore, Weekend Image Fix

### Overview (15:00 UTC)

Three quality-of-life fixes based on gameplay feedback:

1. **Merged Relax + Rest into single "Relax" action** — The two home buttons (Relax: +5 hap/+3 relax, Rest: +1 hap/+8 relax) were essentially the same thing and cluttered the UI. Combined into one "Relax" button with balanced stats (+3 happiness, +5 relaxation). Sleep (8h, +8 hap, +10 hp, +5 relax) remains as the premium option.

2. **Newspaper added back to General Store** — The `onBuyNewspaper` handler was already wired up but no UI button existed. Added a JonesMenuItem for the Town Crier Gazette in the Durables section (before the lottery ticket).

3. **Fixed weekend turn always showing wrong image** — Weekend activities (rw-nap, ticket-jousting, etc.) never showed their correct woodcut images. Root cause: `processLeisure()` pushed messages like `"Weekend: Slept in all weekend..."` with no embedded activity ID. The `extractEventId()` function couldn't match any weekend activity, fell through to default `'weekly-event'` → type fallback `'info'` → showed `economic-boom.jpg` every time. Fix: embed activity ID tag in weekend messages (`[rw-nap] Weekend: ...`) and add weekend-specific regex in `extractEventId()` to find the tag anywhere in multi-line event messages.

### Files Changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/components/game/HomePanel.tsx` | Removed Rest action, merged stats into Relax (+3 hap, +5 relax) |
| `src/components/game/home/HomeActionBar.tsx` | Removed Rest button + all Rest-related props |
| `src/hooks/ai/actions/goalActions.ts` | Merged AI "rest for happiness" and "recuperate for relaxation" into single relax action |
| `src/components/game/GeneralStorePanel.tsx` | Added newspaper JonesMenuItem in Durables section |
| `src/store/helpers/weekEndHelpers.ts` | Embed activity ID in weekend message: `[${activity.id}] Weekend: ...` |
| `src/hooks/useLocationClick.ts` | Added weekend activity ID regex matching; made cleanMessage strip IDs globally |

### Technical Details

**Weekend image fix chain:**
- `weekEndHelpers.ts:535` now produces: `[rw-nap] Weekend: Slept in all weekend...`
- `extractEventId()` new regex: `/\[(rw-[a-z-]+|ticket-[a-z-]+|...-weekend)\]/`
- Matches anywhere in multi-line message (not `^` anchored like travel events)
- `getEventImage('rw-nap')` → finds `weekendNap` in `EVENT_IMAGES` → correct image
- `cleanMessage` regex changed from `/^\[...\]/` to `/\[...\]/g` to strip IDs globally

**Home action before/after:**
- Before: Relax (3-8h, +5 hap, +3 relax) + Rest (4-6h, +1 hap, +8 relax) + Sleep (8h)
- After: Relax (3-8h, +3 hap, +5 relax) + Sleep (8h) — cleaner, no redundancy

## 2026-02-14 - Project Documentation Overhaul

### Overview

Created `log2.md` and `MEMORY.md` to improve project maintainability and AI context continuity.

**Reason**: `log.md` grew to 14,278 lines (732KB) — too large to read in a single pass. New development entries go here in `log2.md`. The original `log.md` is preserved as-is for historical reference.

**MEMORY.md** created as a master project reference — a single document that contains everything an AI assistant (or new developer) needs to understand the full project: architecture, file map, game mechanics, documentation index, development conventions, and current status. It cross-references all other .md files.

### Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `log2.md` | New development log (this file), continuation of log.md |
| `MEMORY.md` | Master project reference — architecture, status, conventions, cross-references |
