// Guild Life - Jobs Data (based on Jones in the Fast Lane)
// Fantasy-themed jobs with degree requirements matching Jones job progression
// All job constant arrays (pure data, no logic)

// With exp gain of ~3/shift (6hr), each career rung requires 5+ shifts.
// Dependability gain reduced to +1/shift, so dep gates now matter for mid-tier jobs.
