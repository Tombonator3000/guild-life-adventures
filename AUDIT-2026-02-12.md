## CRITICAL Findings (4)

### C1. Stale State in `endTurn` After `checkVictory`
- **Area**: Game Store
- **File**: `src/store/helpers/turnHelpers.ts`, `endTurn()`, lines 89-102
- **Description**: When `isNewWeek` is false, `endTurn` captures state via `const state = get()`, then calls `checkVictory()` which can mutate state. The old `state.players` snapshot is used to build the next turn, potentially overwriting mutations from `checkVictory`.
- **Impact**: Subtle data loss — achievement tracking or side-effect mutations from `checkVictory` can be silently overwritten.
- **Fix**: Re-read state via `get()` after `checkVictory()` returns.

### C2. Appliance Breakage Uses Stale Player Object
- **Area**: Game Store
- **File**: `src/store/helpers/startTurnHelpers.ts`, lines 75-98
- **Description**: `processApplianceBreakage` uses a `player` object passed from before breakage mutations, not a re-read from state. The gold threshold check (`player.gold <= 500`) uses stale values.
- **Impact**: Breakage check may use wrong gold value if prior phases in `startTurn` modified gold.
- **Fix**: Re-read player from `get()` before running breakage check.

### C3. Duplicate Item ID `'feast'`
- **Area**: Game Data
- **File**: `src/data/items.ts`, lines 213 and 588
- **Description**: Two items share ID `'feast'` — "Feast Supplies" (General Store, 85g, 100 food) and "Tavern Feast" (Rusty Tankard, 45g, 50 food). `getItem('feast')` returns the first match (General Store version).
- **Impact**: Tavern Feast is unretrievable by ID. Purchasing it may apply wrong stats.
- **Fix**: Rename one ID (e.g., `'tavern-feast'` for the Rusty Tankard version).

### C4. AI Weather Movement Cost Bypass
- **Area**: AI System
- **File**: `src/hooks/ai/actionExecutor.ts`, `handleMove()`, lines 73-84
- **Description**: AI movement cost calculation uses `calculatePathDistance()` which ignores weather modifiers. Human movement correctly adds `weather.movementCostExtra`. During a snowstorm (+1 hour/step), a 5-step trip costs 10 hours for humans but only 5 for AI.
- **Impact**: AI effectively cheats during bad weather — significant competitive advantage.
- **Fix**: Add weather cost to AI movement calculation in `handleMove()`.

---

## HIGH Findings (13)

### H1. Modest Housing Maps to Slums Location
- **Area**: Game Store
- **File**: `src/store/helpers/turnHelpers.ts`, `getHomeLocation()`, lines 16-19
- **Description**: Only checks `housing === 'noble'`, everything else defaults to `'slums'`. Modest housing tenants start turns at Slums location.
- **Impact**: Players paying 95g/week for modest housing get same starting location as 75g slums.
- **Fix**: Add `'modest'` case or remove modest housing tier entirely (Jones only has 2 tiers).

### H2. `payRent` Doesn't Check/Use Prepaid Weeks
- **Area**: Game Store
- **File**: `src/store/helpers/economy/bankingHelpers.ts`, `payRent()`, lines 7-21
- **Description**: Resets `weeksSinceRent: 0` but ignores `rentPrepaidWeeks`. Players waste gold paying rent when already covered by prepaid weeks.
- **Impact**: Gold wasted on redundant rent payments.
- **Fix**: Check `rentPrepaidWeeks > 0` and skip payment (or warn player).

### H3. Loan Default Ignores Investments/Stocks
- **Area**: Game Store
- **File**: `src/store/helpers/weekEndHelpers.ts`, `processLoans()`, lines 353-384
- **Description**: Default only checks `savings` + `gold`, not `investments` or stock holdings. Players can invest loan money, default repeatedly with only -10 happiness penalty, while investments grow.
- **Impact**: Exploitable loan strategy — borrow, invest, default indefinitely.
- **Fix**: Include `investments` in loan default check, or force-liquidate investments on default.

### H4. Two Different Death-Handling Paths
- **Area**: Game Store
- **File**: `src/store/helpers/weekEndHelpers.ts` `processDeathChecks()` vs `src/store/helpers/questHelpers.ts` `checkDeath()`
- **Description**: Week-end death: flat 100g cost, no happiness penalty, no permadeath check, no death event modal. Mid-turn death: scaled cost up to 2000g, happiness penalty, permadeath support, death event UI.
- **Impact**: Week-end deaths are much cheaper and completely bypass permadeath mode.
- **Fix**: Unify death logic — have `processDeathChecks` call the same `checkDeath` action.

### H5. Quest `priest` Education Path Is Opaque
- **Area**: Game Data
- **File**: `src/data/quests.ts`, line 200
- **Description**: Exorcism quest requires `priest level 2`, but the mapping Scholar/Advanced Scholar → priest is hidden in `DEGREE_TO_PATH`. No UI or documentation connects "Scholar Degree" to "priest path".
- **Impact**: Players cannot determine how to meet the requirement. Completely opaque game mechanic.
- **Fix**: Show education path names in Academy UI, or rename paths to match degree names.

### H6. Quest `ancient-evil` Requires Mage Level 3 — Disproportionate
- **Area**: Game Data
- **File**: `src/data/quests.ts`, line 235
- **Description**: A-rank quest requires 3 mage-mapped degrees (minimum 7 total degrees, 420+ hours study, 500+ gold tuition). Harder than S-rank Dragon Slayer quest (only fighter level 2).
- **Impact**: Quest difficulty ranking is inverted — A-rank harder than S-rank.
- **Fix**: Reduce to mage level 2, or move to S-rank.

### H7. Job `location` Field Uses Display Names Not LocationId
- **Area**: Game Data
- **File**: `src/data/jobs/definitions.ts`, all jobs
- **Description**: Jobs use `'Guild Hall'` instead of `'guild-hall'`. The `location` field is typed as `string`, not `LocationId`. Any direct comparison with `LocationId` fails silently.
- **Impact**: Features matching jobs to locations by ID will silently fail.
- **Fix**: Type the field as `LocationId` and use slugs, or add a `locationId` field.

### H8. AI Dungeon Floor 0 Bug — Falsy Check
- **Area**: AI System
- **File**: `src/hooks/ai/actionExecutor.ts`, `handleExploreDungeon()`, lines 388-389
- **Description**: `if (!floorId)` treats floor ID `0` as falsy, blocking AI from entering floor 0.
- **Impact**: AI cannot enter dungeon floor 0 (if floors are 0-indexed).
- **Fix**: Use `if (floorId === undefined || floorId === null)` instead of `!floorId`.

### H9. AI Food Purchases Bypass Store — Hardcoded Values
- **Area**: AI System
- **File**: `src/hooks/ai/actions/criticalNeeds.ts`, lines 28-87
- **Description**: AI uses direct `modifyGold`/`modifyFood` with hardcoded prices (e.g., 10g for 10 food, 25g for 25 food), bypassing the actual item system, price modifiers, and economy effects.
- **Impact**: AI ignores inflation/deflation. Only considers 2 food tiers. Always pays base prices regardless of economy state.
- **Fix**: AI should use `buyItem` or `buyFreshFood` store actions with actual item prices.

### H10. AI Job Upgrade Missing Move Action
- **Area**: AI System
- **File**: `src/hooks/ai/actions/strategicActions.ts`, lines 52-66
- **Description**: AI only upgrades jobs if already at Guild Hall. Does not generate a `move-to` action to travel to Guild Hall for job upgrades.
- **Impact**: Mid-game job upgrades happen only by coincidence when AI happens to be at Guild Hall.
- **Fix**: Add a `move-to-guild-hall` action with appropriate priority before `apply-job`.

### H11. AI Hardcoded Clothing Purchase
- **Area**: AI System
- **File**: `src/hooks/ai/actions/criticalNeeds.ts`, lines 98-117
- **Description**: AI always pays flat 30g for clothing via `modifyGold`/`modifyClothing`, bypassing the actual item system. Never buys higher-quality clothing needed for better jobs (business/uniform tier = 75 threshold).
- **Impact**: AI can never qualify for jobs requiring business or uniform dress code.
- **Fix**: AI should buy specific clothing items based on job requirements.

### H12. Dungeon Health Capped at startHealth — Misleading UI
- **Area**: UI/Combat
- **File**: `src/data/combatResolver.ts`, lines 274-279
- **Description**: Healing in dungeon is capped at `startHealth` (health at entry), not `maxHealth`. The UI shows "+X healed" including wasted healing above the cap. Players entering at 50/100 HP can never heal above 50 HP during the run.
- **Impact**: Players see incorrect healing amounts. Entering dungeon at low HP is disproportionately risky.
- **Fix**: Either cap at `maxHealth` (more generous) or show actual healing applied (not wasted).

### H13. Retreat Gold Penalty Messaging Bug
- **Area**: UI/Combat
- **File**: `src/data/combatResolver.ts` line 343, `src/components/game/CombatView.tsx` lines 122-127
- **Description**: Time-based dungeon exit sets `retreated: true` but does NOT halve gold. However, `FloorSummaryView` shows "You retreated with 50% of your earnings" text for ALL cases where `retreated === true`, including time-based exit.
- **Impact**: Players see "lost 50% gold" message when they actually kept 100%.
- **Fix**: Distinguish `retreated` from `leftDueToTime` in the state, and show correct message.

## MEDIUM Findings (32)

### Game Store (9)

| ID | Finding | File | Description |
|----|---------|------|-------------|
| M1 | Street robbery wipes travel event gold | `src/store/helpers/playerHelpers.ts` `movePlayer()` | If a travel event gives gold AND street robbery fires on the same move, the robbery takes all gold including the event bonus. Player sees "+gold" then immediately loses it. |
| M2 | Eviction clears carried inventory | `src/store/helpers/weekEndHelpers.ts` `processHousing()` | Eviction sets `inventory = []`, clearing carried items. In Jones, only apartment-stored items are lost. Combined with -30 happiness, loss of durables/appliances/equipment, this may be over-punishing. |
| M3 | `payRent` doesn't clear `rentDebt` | `src/store/helpers/weekEndHelpers.ts` + `bankingHelpers.ts` | Rent debt accumulates via weekly processing, but `payRent` only resets `weeksSinceRent`, not `rentDebt`. Players who catch up on rent still get wage garnishment. |
| M4 | `negotiateRaise` no validation | `src/store/helpers/workEducationHelpers.ts` | Accepts any wage value with no bounds check — no job existence check, no wage cap, no minimum. |
| M5 | Shallow clone of players | `src/store/helpers/weekEndHelpers.ts` | `const p = { ...player }` creates shallow clone. Nested object mutations (arrays, records) could corrupt original state. Currently safe but fragile. |
| M6 | `buyStock` not atomic | `src/store/helpers/economy/stockLoanHelpers.ts` | Price read via `get()` and gold check in `set()` are separate. In theory, price could change between them (safe in single-threaded Zustand, theoretical risk in network mode). |
| M7 | Chain quests inflate `completedQuests` | `src/store/helpers/questHelpers.ts` `completeChainQuest()` | Each chain step increments `completedQuests + 1`. A 5-step chain gives 5 completions, inflating adventure victory score vs regular quests. |
| M8 | Guild rank promotion clobbers event messages | `src/store/helpers/questHelpers.ts` `promoteGuildRank()` | Sets `eventMessage` which overwrites any prior event from quest completion. Quest completion message is lost if promotion triggers. |
| M9 | Eviction doesn't reset prepaid weeks | `src/store/helpers/weekEndHelpers.ts` `processHousing()` | Week-end eviction path doesn't clear `rentPrepaidWeeks` or `lockedRent`. The `evictPlayer` action in `questHelpers.ts` DOES clear them. Inconsistency between two eviction paths. |

### Game Data (5)

| ID | Finding | File | Description |
|----|---------|------|-------------|
| M10 | Missing NPC data for 2 locations | `src/data/npcs.ts` | `LOCATION_NPCS` has no entries for `noble-heights` and `slums`. These locations render with fallback/missing NPC information. |
| M11 | Travel event stale randomization | `src/data/travelEvents.ts` | `found-coin-purse` event has `goldEffect: 15 + Math.random()*20` at module load time (executed once). The `rollTravelEvent` function re-randomizes correctly, but the static definition is misleading. |
| M12 | Dungeon Floors 4/5 no healing encounters | `src/data/dungeon/encounters.ts` | Floors 1-3 and 6 have healing encounters. Floors 4 (Dragon's Lair) and 5 (The Abyss) have zero healing. Combined with high damage (55-120 HP risk), these floors are harder than Floor 6, inverting the difficulty curve. |
| M13 | Guild Master's Assistant unreachable | `src/data/jobs/definitions.ts` | Requires 3 degrees (commerce + master-combat + loremaster = minimum 8 unique degrees, 480 hours, 640g). Pays only $2-3/hr more than 2-degree jobs. Practically unreachable. |
| M14 | Deep Dungeon Clear checks 5 of 6 floors | `src/data/quests.ts` | S-rank quest `requiresAllDungeonFloors: true` but code checks `[1,2,3,4,5]` — Floor 6 excluded. Flag name is misleading. |

### AI System (10)

| ID | Finding | File | Description |
|----|---------|------|-------------|
| M15 | `getBestBounty()` wrong Guild Pass check | `src/hooks/ai/strategy.ts` | Function requires Guild Pass for bounties, but bounties are supposed to be available without a pass (only quests need it). |
| M16 | AI food buying inefficient | `src/hooks/ai/actions/criticalNeeds.ts` | AI buys food in small increments (10-25 units) instead of bulk. Never buys General Store provisions (50g for 50 food), the most cost-effective option. |
| M17 | AI homeless/modest rest location wrong | `src/hooks/ai/actions/goalActions.ts` | AI generates `move-to-slums` for rest, but homeless players have no "home" there. Modest tenants should arguably go to a modest location. |
| M18 | AI pawning triggers too late | `src/hooks/ai/actions/economicActions.ts` | Pawn threshold is gold < 30. By this point, AI often can't afford food (10g) or rent (75g). Should trigger at ~75g. |
| M19 | Failed actions consume action limit | `src/hooks/ai/useGrimwaldAI.ts` | Max 15 actions per turn. Failed actions (e.g., can't buy, wrong location) still count. AI can hit limit with mostly failures. |
| M20 | Stock market only for wealth-focused | `src/hooks/ai/actions/economicActions.ts` | AI only buys/sells stocks when wealth is weakest goal. Thornwick (merchant personality) should always consider stock market. |
| M21 | `weatherMoveCostMult` dead code | `src/hooks/ai/types.ts` + `actionGenerator.ts` | Context field is set but never read by any action generator. Weather movement cost is not used in AI decision-making. |
| M22 | Quest actions ignore personality | `src/hooks/ai/actionGenerator.ts` | Quest and bounty action priorities are not weighted by personality multipliers. Morgath (warrior) gets no combat boost for dungeon/quest actions. |
| M23 | Adventure goal no quest priority | `src/hooks/ai/actions/goalActions.ts` | Adventure goal handler focuses on dungeon floors but doesn't prioritize completing active quests for the adventure score. |
| M24 | Banking ignores personality | `src/hooks/ai/strategy.ts` | All AI personalities use the same gold buffer for banking (200-300g). Thornwick (merchant, cautious) should use higher buffer. |

### UI/Combat (8)

| ID | Finding | File | Description |
|----|---------|------|-------------|
| M25 | Stale closure in turn transition | `src/components/game/GameBoard.tsx` lines 93-101 | useEffect dependency array `[currentPlayer?.id, phase]` missing `isMultiHuman` and `lastHumanPlayerId`. Privacy screen could show/hide incorrectly after player elimination. |
| M26 | Stale player prop for time check | `src/components/game/CombatView.tsx` lines 64-70 | `hasEnoughTime` reads `player.timeRemaining` from props (snapshot), but time is deducted via `onSpendTime` without updating props immediately. Button state may lag by one render. |
| M27 | Damage reduction not clamped | `src/data/combatResolver.ts` lines 219-222 | `(1 - eduBonuses.damageReduction - modDmgReduc)` is not clamped to minimum 0. If future modifiers push sum above 1.0, damage becomes negative (healing). `Math.max(1, d)` at line 231 saves it but intermediate calculation is fragile. |
| M28 | Career = 0 when unemployed | `src/components/game/GoalProgress.tsx` line 28 | Career progress is `player.currentJob ? player.dependability : 0`. Losing a job drops career goal progress to 0 instantly, even if dependability is high. Very frustrating UX. |
| M29 | No accessibility labels | Multiple files | Many `<div onClick>` elements lack `role="button"`, `tabIndex`, `aria-label`. Location zones not keyboard-navigable. Game inaccessible to keyboard/screen-reader users. |
| M30 | Wrong retreat message for time exit | `src/components/game/combat/FloorSummaryView.tsx` lines 124-129 | Shows "50% penalty" text for all `retreated === true` cases, but time-based exit keeps 100% gold. Message doesn't match behavior. |
| M31 | CavePanel direct store mutation | `src/components/game/CavePanel.tsx` lines 124-131, 177-195 | Uses `useGameStore.setState()` directly instead of Zustand actions. Bypasses middleware, won't work with undo/redo, potential race condition in multiplayer. |
| M32 | Newspaper purchase no gold check | `src/components/game/LocationPanel.tsx` lines 52-59 | `handleBuyNewspaper` calls `modifyGold(player.id, -price)` without checking if player has enough gold. Gold can go negative. |

## Gameplay Improvement Suggestions

### Combat & Dungeon
1. **Dungeon Floor Healing**: Add at least 1 healing encounter to Floors 4 and 5 to smooth difficulty curve
2. **Equipment Warning**: Show penalty text before entering dungeon without equipment
3. **Dungeon Entry Health**: Consider capping healing at `maxHealth` instead of `startHealth`
4. **Cave Rest Cooldown**: Add diminishing returns (e.g., -5 HP healed per additional rest in same turn)
5. **Blessed Ground Fix**: Align actual damage reduction (36%) with description (20%)

### AI System
6. **Bulk Food Buying**: AI should use General Store provisions (50g/50 food) instead of multiple small purchases
7. **Personality-Weighted Quests**: Apply combat/education/wealth multipliers to quest-related AI actions
8. **Banking Personality**: Use `goldBuffer` personality trait in banking strategy
9. **AI Pawn Threshold**: Raise from 30g to ~75g to prevent death spirals
10. **AI Clothing Strategy**: Buy clothing items matching job requirements instead of flat 30g purchase

### User Experience
11. **Career Goal UX**: Show dependability stat even when unemployed (don't reset to 0)
12. **Turn End Confirmation**: Add "Are you sure?" dialog when player has 20+ hours remaining
13. **Quest Path Display**: Show education path mappings (fighter/mage/priest/business) in Academy UI
14. **Accessibility**: Add `role="button"`, `tabIndex`, and `aria-label` to interactive elements

### Data & Balance
15. **Quest Difficulty Alignment**: Rebalance `ancient-evil` (A-rank harder than S-rank)
16. **Guild Master's Assistant**: Reduce from 3 to 2 degree requirements, or significantly increase wage
17. **Chain Quest Scoring**: Consider counting chain completion as 1 quest, not N steps, for victory score
